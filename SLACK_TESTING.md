# Slack Integration Testing Guide

## Quick Test Instructions

### Test 1: Configuration & Connection Test

// This will trigger the visitor detection logic
// Note: The actual implementation uses WebSocket, so this is for testing only
```

**Expected Slack Message:**
```
üÜï New Visitor on Your Website

Company: [Company Name]

5. Wait for the video call session to be created
6. ‚úÖ Should receive Slack notification with video call details

**Expected Slack Message:**
```
üìû Video Call Request Initiated

Company: [Company Name]
Status: üü¢ Call Ready

üîó Quick Actions:
